# kitbox
This Android app aims to implement a comprehensive item co-sharing feature to make it
easier for users to donate pieces of the resource. Our project name is "KitBox," and the
application concept base on the (Patakakai) Open street food pantry movement and
compensates the missing real-time information https://www.patakai.co.nz. Moreover, this
application is targeting to have three essential functions. First, the social media interface,
namely "home," it allows users to read those donated items. Second, the item input which
allows user to capture an image and some necessary information then upload to the
application system. Third, a google map service that can show the donation resources in the
exact location.
